/**
 * @file KinematicParameters.hpp
 * 
 * @brief Defines the KinematicParameters class, which contains parameters for controlling the behavior of 
 *        iterative inverse kinematics algorithms, such as the Jacobian pseudo-inverse method. The parameters 
 *        include tolerances for position and orientation errors, maximum iterations, step increments, and momentum.
 * 
 * This header file provides the definition of the KinematicParameters class, outlining various parameters 
 * that influence the convergence and accuracy of inverse kinematics solutions for robotic arms.
 * 
 * @class KinematicParameters
 * 
 * @details The KinematicParameters class encapsulates various settings used during the computation of inverse 
 *          kinematics. These settings determine the convergence criteria and step sizes for iterative solvers, 
 *          allowing fine-tuning of the algorithmâ€™s performance and precision.
